Overview
========

Dyndesign is a toolkit that offers developers the utmost flexibility in
dynamically designing class structures.

Dyndesign empowers developers to **build classes** by effortlessly incorporating
class dependencies, including **parent** and **component** classes, through a set
of configuration options. Dyndesign also provides the capability to **modify the
inheritance hierarchy** of existing classes as well as to **merge classes** as
though they were dictionaries.

In order to manage the communication between dynamically interconnected classes
effectively, a dedicated set of tools is provided, enabling developers to
**safely utilize resources** from classes that **may or may not be
interconnected** to other classes.

The primary objective of DynDesign is to adhere to several software engineering
principles such as the Single Responsibility and Open-Closed Principles from the
**SOLID** acronym, along with the **DRY** and **KISS** concepts.
