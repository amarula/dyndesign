Overview
========

Dyndesign is a toolkit that offers developers the utmost flexibility in
dynamically designing class structures. It empowers developers to **modify the
class inheritance hierarchy** as well as to **merge classes** as though they
were working with dictionaries.

In order to manage the communication between dynamically interconnected classes
effectively, a dedicated set of tools is provided, enabling developers to
**safely utilize resources** from classes that **may or may not be
interconnected** to other classes.

The primary objective of DynDesign is to adhere to several software engineering
principles such as the Single Responsibility and Open-Closed Principles from the
**SOLID** acronym, along with the **DRY** and **KISS** concepts.
